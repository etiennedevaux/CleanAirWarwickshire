        <p>Air pollution is a serious public health issue. It contributes to about 1 in 20 deaths in our town and
          affects the well-being of many of us, especially those with existing medical conditions. Everyone deserves to
          breathe clean, safe air that is within internationally agreed limits.</p>
        <p class="cafl-quote">"Clean air is a basic requirement of human health and well-being. Air pollution, however,

        <p>Warwick District Council figures show that traffic emissions are the biggest cause of local air pollution so

        <h1>Improve Our Town</h1>
        <p>We know that clean air is a key improvement that people want. As a result, local government, businesses and
          private households in the town are all doing things around you to help promote a better, cleaner environment.
        </p>
        <p>The first objective in the ‘Transport’ section of the Royal Leamington Spa Neighbourhood Development Plan is
          ‘To reduce vehicle traffic emissions, improve air quality and increase access to and use of sustainable
          transport modes across Royal Leamington Spa’.</p>

        <p>Below are some examples of organisations doing their bit for Clean Air in Leamington Spa:</p>


        <section id="cafl-improve-cafl" class="cafl-improve-dropdown">
          <h1><button class="cafl-expand"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></button><button class="cafl-collapse"><i
                class="fas fa-minus"></i></button> Clean Air for Leamington Spa </h1>
          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">Clean Air for Leamington Spa is actively working to achieve our vision of a
            town where air quality is excellent, people are prioritised over vehicles, there is a high degree of active
            travel and people actively support clean air. Some highlights include:</p>

          <ul class="cafl-improve-detail">
            <li>Anti-Idling</li>
            <li>Clean Air for Leamington Spa Website</li>
            <li>Social Media Presence</li>
            <li>Raising Clean Air Concerns with Local Government</li>
            <li>Liaison with Clean Air Warwick</li>
            <li>Liaison with Cycleways</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">We have been working with WCC transport planners, trying to understand current
            measures intended to improve air quality and encourage planning decisions that prioritise sustainable modes
            of transport rather than motor vehicles. A Clean Air Zone is being explored, as are 20mph limits in town,
            and a comprehensive cycle network. As well as infrastructure changes, we want to see the behavioural
            changes, like ride-share to work and walk to school schemes that will decrease traffic flow and improve air
            quality. Our Air Quality Summit last October chaired by our MP Matt Western captured public attention and
            generated a lot of enthusiasm.</p>

        <h1>Keeping the Air Clean</h1>
        <p>Keeping the air clean does not just depend on what those around you are doing, you can make a big difference
          with some small changes.</p>
        <p>The biggest source of air pollution is motorised transport, so most of our suggestions focus on how you move
          around the town.</p>
        <p>Below are some things you can do to help keep the air clean in your town</p>

        <section id="cafl-keep-active" class="cafl-improve-dropdown">

                class="fas fa-minus"></i></button> Active Transport</h1>
          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">Active transport is transport based on physical activity, usually walking or
            cycling. Being active in your daily commute will help to make you fit and healthy, whilst keeping the
            streets less congested and the air cleaner.

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">If you can walk to school or college. If it is too far to walk, then consider
            cycling. For longer school journeys there is usually public transport, use it if you can.</p>

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">If your work is very close you may be fortunate enough to be able to walk, if
            not then consider cycling. For longer commutes, public transport is usually the cleanest and least expensive
            option, use it if you can.</p>
          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">If you really have to use a car for work, then take comfort from the others who
            are avoiding using their cars, making your commute less congested, shorter and less stressful.</p>

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">At Clean Air for Leamington we love motorists, let's face it most of us are
            motorists on occasions. The motorists we love the most are those who use their cars as little as possible

            can, the less congested the roads will be and the less polluting those few essential journeys will become.

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">The AA, and RAC, advice on good driving includes minimising engine idling. But
            we think reducing idling is such an easy way to keep the air clean, we want this to be a major campaign for
            all road users.</p>

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">Public transport, where it is available, is a clean and cost-effective way to
            get to work. The more we use public transport the more it will be economic to provide it.</p>

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">After motorised transport, the next biggest contributor to air pollution is
            burning wood or fossil fuels. Almost whatever you are burning it is likely to be adding to air pollution,
            burning garden waste is one of the biggest sources of harmful particulates. The more you avoid burning wood,
            coal or other fossil fuels the cleaner the air will be.</p>

          <p class="cafl-improve-detail">Electricity is a clean source of energy, especially if it is not produced by
            the burning of fossil fuels. Solar panels provide households with cheap and clean electricity, plus they can
            often provide electricity to a neighbourhood by giving back to the grid.</p>

                <p>Dear Madam or Sir,</p>
                <p>I am contacting you to ask if you could kindly remind your drivers about unnecessary engine idling.</p>
                <p>Idling engines when not required is extremely damaging for health, particularly of young or vulnerable people, and the environment. It is, of course, also an avoidable business expense for you.</p>
                <p>My message to you today has been prompted by seeing one of your drivers idling their engine whilst stationary, in Leamington Spa in Warwickshire. We understand that on occasions it may be necessary for drivers to keep their engines running whilst stationary, but when it is not necessary we would really
                  appreciate it if drivers would switch off their engines.</p>
                  <p>Here in Leamington Spa, where the air quality is worse than in most of the country, most companies we approach are more than happy to help out in this way, and we would appreciate any cooperation from
                    drivers and companies like yours to make our town a bit healthier for us and our children.</p>
                <p>Thank you so much in anticipation of your understanding and help.</p>

                <p>Dear Madam or Sir,</p>
                <p>Clean Air for Leamington have started a campaign to raise awareness about the detrimental effect of idling on our health and environment. We are contacting you to ask whether you would be willing to help us spread this important message.</p>
                <p>An idling engine can produce up to twice as many exhaust emissions as an engine in motion. Exhaust emgines when stationary. Perhaps you might even consider making it your company policy and we would, in turn, be happy to name  you as a a supporter of  the campaign on our website and in social media. If you prefer, we can deliver  you a printed poster and some fliers, at a convenient time.  issions contain a range of air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. These can affect the air quality of the surrounding environment and the air we breathe, potentially leading to a number of major health concerns.</p>
                <p>We have attached a poster and a flyer to this email, which illustrates the dangers of idling.</p>
                  <p>It would be great if you would display this in your window or use it to remind your visitors, employees and customers to switch off their engines when not needed.</p>
                  <p>We hope that you will help us share this message and will work with us to make a significant  improvement to air quality in Leamington. 
                  </p>
